<p>Once I have a better grasp on JS, HTML, & CSS, I plan on building 2 specific websites. The first is an interactive website for my current work-from-home hustle. (No, it isn't an MLM.) The second is an interactive website for my husband's leatherworking business <a href="etsy.com/HideandSneakByMalakk">Hide and Sneak</a>, with photo gallery, e-store, contact page, and a password protected bulletin board section.</p>
